          <h2>How to Use This</h2>
          <p>This project was extremely exploratory, and throughout each phase we made research and design decisions (which can be seen in the full documentation) that took us on a parth towards a curved screen interface. However, along the way, there were options that were left behind. The below list is not inclusive of well-vetted and realized idea, but rather concepts that ended up did not end up being incorporated but are still worthy of exploration.</p>
          <p> Please use this as a retrospective into unexplored opportunities, as well as a roadmap for the future.</p>

                  <p>We chose to focus on levels 3-4 of autonomy because it will be most people's first explosure to autonomy and opens up conversations about building trust between humans and autonomy.</p>

                  <p>A rich area of additional exploration is the grey area of responsibility that can obscure knowing who has control over particular functions of the car. This is especially true with advanced ADAS features in which humans have more control over some features, but not others (such as having the AI control speed & tail distance, but not brake assist). This has the opportunity to create cognitive dissonance with a user's mental model of autonomy.</p>

                  <p>Of course, exploring L5 autonomy can open up a wealth of opportunities with passenger interaction, but has a longer lead time for development and deployment.</p>

                  <p>If the timeline were to be extended to 5+ years out, we could assume that autonomous technology to be more smoothed.

                  <ul>

                    <li>What is the difference of shared autonomy and public transit?</li>
                    <li>How do public and private spaces in vehicles differ?</li>
                    <li>Does engaging in secondary tasks while being driven cause car sickness?</li>

                    <li>What would people do with the ability to jailbreak their AV?</li>
                    <li>Do human drivers think they're above the mean, and does impact their preference for control?</li>
                    <li>Will "manual" driving be seen as a special hobby? will it be cheaper or more expensive?</li>
                    <li>Will there be stunted driving ability in those with dependencies on autonomous features?</li>
                  </ul>

                  <ul>
                    <li>How can AV's improve the world/society? Is there a pro-social aspect?</li>
                    <li>What accessibility markets can AV's serve?</li>
                    <li>Who are the under served populations that can benefit?</li>

                  <ul>
                    <li>What modality do people prefer when interacting with AVs (voice vs haptic vs traditional)?</li>

                    <li>How do mobile ecosystems change the way users perceive their experience?</li>
                    <li>Why do people use Apple Carplay or Android Auto?</li>

                    Users need the right amount of transparency into the workings of the AV system. What is necessary to show, what is too much, and how should this information be displayed?

                  <p>One of the key concepts of our product is the curved shape. The slope and unique S-curve shape allows users to know where their hand is physically on the control, and which control options are available.</p>

                  <p>This creates a type of hybrid-tangibility; the physical curve of the screen acts as an affordance of interactions as well as having digital feedback of your actions. However, there are additional techniques that should be included in the next version that further foster these benefits:</p>

                  <ul>
                    <li>Haptic feedback to make thresholds and confirmations more salient, using vibrations as resistance, as well as notifying of the level of speed or lane shift that is happening</li>
                    <li>Audio prompt notifications to avoid change</li>
                    <li>Feedback tones for confirmation and understanding</li>
                    <li>Static textures to create different zones and incorporating hand-feel as a signifier</li>
                    <li>Refreshing textures and responsive glass to indicate zones of operations</li>
                    <li>Adjustable mounting allowing users to move the screen for comfort</li>
                    <li>Responsive slope: placing actuators behind the OLED screen to make the slope of the curve responsive and map to the speed. The steeper slope, the higher speed the car is moving, the harder it would be to speed up due to more friction when swiping up because less speed gain is available.</li>

                    Our research indicated that the amount of info shown to the user is vital. Too much information (showing a user a direct video stream of the car's computer vision) leaves people feeling even more overwhelmed and confused. Too little information, and the user doesn't know if the AI has enough situational awareness and understanding of the environment and world around it.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Through testing we were able to uncover that it is vital to show that the AI sees a user's command (immediate action feedback) and that the car is then following through on that command and executing the intent. We also were able to see that some users wanted to have more specific information about the world around them, not just trusting that the car knows the boundaries of a lane or what options are available to execute in the form of a prompt.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The AI also needs to explain to the user why it is not executing something. It is a level of visibility and transparency that may not quite available with existing technology, but it is vital to the success of the human-AI relationship.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The limitations of our testing environment in terms of realism did not allow us to push the boundaries of how much or how little environmental information the user needs to see in order to feel safe both in giving contol over to the car and before making a decision.
